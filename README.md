## Configuration

### Port and Redirect URL

The default port is `8000`.

The default redirect route is `/login`.

So, the application expects to get a redirect request at `http://localhost:8000/login` after successful login. Either update your `Redirect URL` in Kite Developer Portal or update the login handler route. To change the port, update the `dev` and `start` scripts in `package.json`.

### config.ts

Edit `src/config.ts` to configure:

- `STOCKS_TO_INCLUDE` - Update list of stocks which should be monitored

## Setup

Install dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

Setup environment secrets in an `env.json` file by copying the `example.env.json` file. For further customisation, see [configuration](#configuration).

```sh
cd src
cp example.env.json env.json
# Populate env.json secrets
```

Start the app to login for the first time to get and cache your access token.

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should see a "Session Expired" message in the top right corner. Click on it and login
After successful login, click on the refresh data button to fetch or update instrument data.

## Usage

Start in development mode

```
npm run dev
```

Build and start production server.

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

## Future plans

- Implementing an exit strategy for the stock pair that did enter
- Configurable number of pairs to enter/exit along with configurable entry basis percentages
